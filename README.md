- Objects within an Array
- Interval Timers and Timeout Timers

# How users can get started with the project
Begin by clicking through the questions. Notice how right/wrong answers are registered as well as when time runs out before an answer is registered. The next question can be pulled up automatically if it is not done so manually. The score is tracked until the end and displayed along with an option to play again.
